The credit transactions created necessity to maintain accounts, and accounting is as old as business itself. Accounting was practiced in India, from ancient time in the form of exchanging goods for animals , barter system, clay tokens etc.
In 1494, the system of book-keeping was first introduced by Luca Pacioli, a Fraciscan monk who is also known as the FATHER OF ACCOUNTING. The book titled De Computic at Scripturies (Italian) dealt with the use of memorandum book, journals and ledgers. This work was published in English by Hugh Old Castle in 1543. Later, James Pule improved the method of book-keeping for the purpose of accounts of debtors and creditors.The most important work on accounting was published in 1795 by Edward Jones, who innovated two columns in the journal entries. From time to time, various innovations in accounting were introduced.
The modern system of accounting is originated on the principles of Double Entry System.

Branches / Types of accounting:
Accounting is a dynamic profession and it is constantly adapting itself to the specific and varying needs of its users. Over the past  decades, accountancy has different types of accounting to cater for the diversity of needs of its users.
Financial Accounting is the process of producing information for external use in the form of financial statements. Financial Statements reflect an entity's of past performance and current position based on some set of standards and guidelines known as GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). GAAP refers to the guideline for financial accounting used in any given jurisdiction. This generally includes accounting standards (e.g. International Financial Reporting Standards), accounting conventions, and rules and regulations that accountants must follow in preparation of the financial statements.
Management Accounting produces information primarily for internal use of the company's management. The information produced for the external use to enable effective organization control and fulfillment of the strategic objectives of the entity. Information can be in the form of budgets and forecasts, which can enable an enterprise to plan its future effectively or may include an assessment based on past performance and results. The content and forms of any report produced in the process is totally upon management's discretion.
Cost accounting is a branch of management accounting and it involves the application of various techniques which is used to monitor and control costs. Its application is suited for manufacturing concerns.
Governmental Accounting is also known as public accounting or federal accounting which refers to the type of accounting information system used in the public sector. This has a slight deviation from the financial accounting system used in the private sector. There is a  need to have a separate accounting system for the public sectors because of the different aims and objectives of the privately owned and some state owned institutions. This accounting ensures that the financial position of the public sector institutions are set in budgetary context since financial constraints are often a major concern of many government entities. Separate rules are to be  followed in many jurisdictions to account for the transactions and events of public entities.
Tax Accounting refers to accounting matters which are related to tax. It is governed by the rules prescribed by the tax laws of a jurisdiction. And these rules are different from the rules that govern the preparation of financial statements for public use (i.e. GAAP). Tax accountants adjust the financial statements prepared under financial accounting principles to account the differences with rules prescribed by the laws which are related to tax. Information is then used by tax professionals to estimate tax liability of a company and for further tax planning purposes.
Forensic Accounting is used for auditing and investigative techniques in cases of litigation or disputes. Forensic accountants act as a witnesses in courts of law in civil and criminal disputes that basically require an assessment of the financial effects of a loss or the detection of a fraud. Common litigation where forensic accountants are hired that includes insurance claim, suspected fraud and claims of professional negligence in a financial matter (e.g. business valuation) etc.
Project Accounting refers to track the financial progress of a project through various financial reports. Project accounting is important component of project management. It is a specialized branch of management accounting with a focus on ensuring the financial success of a company projects such as launch of a new product. Project accounting can be a source of competitive advantage for the project-oriented businesses such as construction firms.
Social Accounting, also known as Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting and Sustainability Accounting which refers to the process of reporting implications of an organization's activities on its social environment. Social Accounting is primarily reported in the form of Environmental Reports and annual reports of companies.

Journalising Transactions
Journal
It is the book of original entry in which, after following all the rules of debit and credit, all these business transactions are recorded in a chronological order. This word has been derived from French word ‘jour’, which means ‘a day’. Thus we can say that it is a book which records all the transactions of money on the daily basis.
The structure of a general is:
1.	A header line include a journal entry number and date.
2.	The 1st column includes acc no. and acc name into which the entry is recorded. This field is set when the topic is of account being credited.
3.	The 2nd column contain the debited amount.
4.	The 3rd column contains the credited amount to be enterd.
5.	The last and the footer line may include the description of the reason for the entry.
Objectives of journal :
* It is prepared to keep a systematic record of financial transactions.
* It is prepared to show financial transactions in chronological order.
*  It is prepared to present necessary information about the financial transactions.
* It is prepared to use as a legal evidence of financial transactions.
*       It is prepared to facilitate the preparation of ledger book.
Advantages of journal:
1.	It provides records of all business transaction in one place.
2.	These all transactions are recorded on the basis of receipts or bill.
3.	Minimum chance to avoid any particular transaction because in this transaction the data is recorded on date basis.
4.	Every journal is recorded after the deep analysis of two accounts on the basis of double entry system.
Disadvantages of journal:
1.	These are bulky and voluminous.
2.	The information is In scattered form.
3.	These are time consuming.
4.	They lack in their internal control.
Rules of debit and credit:
•	All accounts which contain a debit balance will increase in amount when a debit is added to them, and reduced when a credit is added to them. The types of accounts to which this rule applies are expenses and dividends.
•	All accounts which contain a credit balance will increase in amount when a credit is added to them, and reduced when a debit is added to them. The types of accounts to which this rule applies are liabilities and equity.
•	Contra types of accounts reduce the balances of the accounts with which they are paired. This means that a contra account paired with an asset account behaves as though it were a liability account.
•	The total amount of debits in a transaction must equal the total amount of credits in a transaction. Otherwise, a transaction is said to be unbalanced, and the financial statements from which a transaction is constructed will be inherently incorrect. An accounting software package will flag any journal entries that are unbalanced.
Compound journal entry:
It is a accounting entry which affects three or more than three  heads. A simple entry has always two rows i.e.  debit and credit. Whereas the compound journal has three or more than three rows.
Example
On Date 01/08/2017 Purchase goods from siddharth worth Rs. 30,000/- and paid him Rs. 5,000/- in cash and 25,000/- By cheque.
In this  transaction three accounts are involved shown as below:
