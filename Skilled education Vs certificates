Skilled Education VS Certificates/Degrees

Introduction
Skill and degree are the two common words in our day to day life. If you want to succeed  in life you need to have both degree as well as the skills as degree make you confident in terms of qualification and skills make you perfectionist in your qualification.  A degree which is without the skill and vice-versa are of no use. Both are equally important to each other. Degree is nothing but a certificate which defines your certified documentation of your acquired skill.

- Degree is just only the certificate that the person applying for the post is having the knowledge of the work requirement and has the ability to manage the functioning and justify the post.

- Degree makes a person more confident in an company while applying because he has a piece of paper which defines his qualification and also these degrees are an essential part of the personality development because nowadays most of the people chosen for the interview is on the basis of their degree only..

- Degree converts a  person into polite, humble and wiser as per the qualification in the degree. This helps us in order to take charge of the job or to climb the success ladder. But when we don’t have the degree in hand these things are very difficult to manage.

- A degree has it own respect and social reputation. A person is treated through his qualifications which is reflected by his degree.

- Degree earns money and status for the individual. The more qualified the degree, the higher the post and status and higher is the income.

- Every degree holder is not always a skilled person. Skill is the only asset that helps to achieve the target and not the degree.

- Skill is an abstract term which cannot be shown on just a piece of paper. It is a widespread spectrum which is groomed within the individual and nurtured through the repeated practical implications in life.

- It is not always the degree but the skill that is used to achieve the success in life. A degree can just be used to earn the job, but it cannot help to grow your future without the skill.

- It is always the skill which is used to attracts the employers, clients and management which lifts or drops the person. Without the skill, the person will not be able to catch and hold the interest of their superiors and attain success.

- The great people from the history which we have known till now are all skilled people, but they didn’t had the certifications for their knowledge.

                                      Conclusion
Degree is basically the theoretical evaluation of an abstract concept which is virtually not possible. It is the skill that only helps the person to grow in both materially / financially field in future  and immaterially with respect to the status, importance, social respect and recognition etc. Degree definitely has its own importance because when  a persohave some of the skills then only he is able to achieve that degree. A complete inarticulate person cannot qualify to attain the degree. Hence, we can say that the degree is the first step in the ladder of skills which leads to the success in life.
